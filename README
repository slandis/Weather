weather-local

A sloppy script to snarf weather XML from the National Weather
Service, slap it into a SQLite database and generate an HTML5
graph of the history.

WHAT YOU WILL NEED:
Rgraph  (a very nice HTML5 graphing library) placed in js/
SQLite3 Just install and there you are
Perl Modules Needed: XML::Simple, Date::Parse, DBI

First, install the needed PERL modules via CPAN or your package
manager if your distribution has them.

Then unpack RGraph into js/ and follow any instructions
for installation. Second, fire up sqlite3 and create the
database in table.sql (hint: cat table.sql | sqlite3 weather.db)

Then install the cronfile cron.cmd, which will run the snarf
and archive script once every hour. Setup your web server to
display index.html somewhere (ie /weather/index.html) and let
the magic begin.

Okay, it's not magic. But it works for what I want it to do.
